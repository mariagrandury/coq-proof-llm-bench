Then, we can use these implications to prove that Reptile -> Bird.\n\nWe can start by introducing the first implication H1, and then the second implication H2. \n\nThen, we can introduce a variable x of type Ind, and use the first implication H1 to prove that Reptile x -> Cat x. \n\nNext, we can use the second implication H2 to prove that Cat x -> Bird x. \n\nFinally, we can use the transitivity of implication to prove that Reptile x -> Bird x.\n\n``` \nProof.\nintros H1 H2\nQed."}

Then, we can use these implications to prove that Reptile -> Bird.\n\nWe can start by introducing the first implication H1, and then the second implication H2. \n\nThen, we can introduce a variable x of type Ind, and use the first implication H1 to prove that Reptile x -> Cat x. \n\nNext, we can use the second implication H2 to prove that Cat x -> Bird x. \n\nFinally, we can use the transitivity of implication to prove that Reptile x -> Bird x.\n\n``` \nProof.\nintros H1 H2\nQed."}
