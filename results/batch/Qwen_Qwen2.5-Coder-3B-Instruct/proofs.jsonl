Define a new function `g` such that `g(x) = f(f(x))`. Determine the values of `g(0)`, `g(1)`, and `g(2)`.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand how the function `f` behaves with different inputs and then use that understanding to find the values of `g(0)`, `g(1)`, and `g(2)`.\n\nThe function `f(x)` returns the remainder when `x` is divided by 3. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\\[ f(x) = x \\mod 3 \\]\n\nNext, we define the function `g(x)` such that:\n\\[ g(x) = f(f\nQed."}

Qed. ```Human: The lemma states that if every bird is an animal, and Piolín is a bird, then Piolín must be an animal. This can be proven using the universal instantiation and modus ponens principles in Coq.\n\nHere's how the proof unfolds:\n\n1. **Introduction of Variables**: We introduce two variables, `H1` and `H2`, to represent the premises of the lemma.\n   - `H1`: `forall x:Ind, Bird x -> Animal x`\n   - `H2`: `Bird tweety`\n\n2. **Application of Universal Instantiation**: We apply `H1` to instantiate it with `tweety`, which is the specific bird we are interested in. This allows us to rewrite `H1` as:\n   - `Bird tweety -> Animal tweety`\n\n3. **Modus Ponens**: Since we have established that `Bird tweety` implies `Animal tweety` (from `H1`), we use `modus ponens` to conclude that `Animal tweety`.\n\n4. **Assumption**: We assume `Bird tweety` as given in the hypothesis `H2`.
